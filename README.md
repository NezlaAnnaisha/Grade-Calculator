# Description
Grade Calculator project from CPSC217 of Winter 2023.

**Project is under the folder "application". This used to be a repository for other assignments, where Grade Calculator was one of them.

## Assignment Overwiew
There are a total of 5 CC (coding challenges; or assignments) for the project. The due dates are as followed:


- [x] **Iteration 1:** Creating a Graphical User Interface using JavaFX - _Jan.13, 2023_
    - *Description*: Create the base of the calculator application. Have separate widgets for required coding challenges and optional coding challenges.
      - There are 15 required coding challenges.
      - There are 7 optional coding challenges. Only five will be used when computing thecourse grades. (There are no bonus marks for completing more than five coding challenges.)
      - Update to reflect actual maximum possible quiz grade this semester.


- [x] **Iteration 2:** Event Handling using JavaFX - _Jan.18, 2023_
    - *Description*: Continue with the previous coding challenge to accurately compute the user’s course grade based on the information they entered in the user interface.
      - Have one choice box for required coding challenges and one choice box for optional coding challenges.
      - Update to reflect actual maximum possible quiz grade this semester.
      - Update to reflect the actual weight of each course component toward the course grade.
        
      Remember that:
      - There are no bonus marks for completing more than 5 optional coding challenges.
      - All coding challenges (optional and required) are equally weighted towards the coding challenge component.

        
- [x] **Iteration 3:** Validating User Input - _Jan.27, 2023_
    - *Description*: Update the code to allow decimal numbers for the project grade (positive integers). Ensure that validation of any type of input that the user can provide is done accurately and testing is done with both valid/invalid inputs.


- [x] **Iteration 4:** Changing the Scene - _Feb.03, 2023_
    - *Description*: Continue with the previous coding challenge and update the grade calculator code. Separate the entry of grades for required quizzes and optional quizzes:
        - There are 15 required quizzes. All 15 are used to calculate the average of the required quiz grades.
        - There are 7 optional quizzes. The user should have the option to enter between 1 to 7 quiz grades. Only the 5 highest quiz grades should be used to calculate the average.
        - Users will enter their quiz grade out of 10.
      
        Update the main scene to display the average quiz grades calculated:
        - When the application starts, it should show that both averages are 0.0.
        - After the user has entered their quiz grades for either the required or optional quizzes, it should show an updated value for the average quiz grade.


- [x] **Iteration 5:** Creating our own ‘Library’ Class - _Feb.08, 2023_
    - Description: Continue with the previous coding challenge. This last iteration of the Grade Calculator should ensure that:
        - The user can accurately calculate their course grade.
        - User input for project and quiz grades are validated (decimal numbers for project and quiz grades).
        - Error message displayed are helpful to the user.
